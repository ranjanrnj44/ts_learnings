//
// unknown is recommended over any because it provides safer typing â€” you have to use type assertion or narrow to a specific type if you want to perform operations on unknown
//NOTE we cannot use certain type convert (i.e 10 as string), still it can be force made using type fore casting using 2 as assertion
//10 as string; // ERR, can't use directly
10 as unknown as string; // working no err

// DOM access with assertion
//non null assertion
